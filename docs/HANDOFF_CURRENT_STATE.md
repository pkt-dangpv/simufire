# Current Handoff State

Date: 2026-06-17.

## Purpose

This note records the repository hygiene and validation state after the non-motor cleanup. It is meant to let another machine or contributor continue without relying on chat history.

## What Changed

- Root-level session notes moved to `docs/sessions/root/`.
- Historical audits, plans, roadmaps, validation docs and architecture docs were grouped under `docs/`.
- Local bibliography and PDFs moved from `Docu Simufire/` to `docs/literature/`.
- Loose root artifacts kept for context moved to `docs/archive/root-artifacts/`.
- Exploratory root scripts moved to `tools/archive/root-scripts/`.
- Documentation entrypoints, command references, artifact policy, release checklist and architecture governance docs were added.
- Lightweight docs/product CI workflows and helper scripts were added.

## Key Entry Points

- Project overview: `README.md`
- Documentation index: `docs/INDEX.md`
- Official commands: `docs/COMMANDS.md`
- Cleanup status: `docs/REPO_STATUS_AFTER_CLEANUP.md`
- Validation guardrails status: `docs/validation/GUARDRAILS_STATUS.md`
- Gap inventory: `docs/validation/GAPS_INVENTORY.md`
- Commit split proposal: `docs/COMMIT_PLAN.md`
- PR summary draft: `docs/PR_DESCRIPTION.md`

## Validation Run

Commands run on 2026-06-17:

```powershell
python scripts\check_docs_links.py
python -m unittest tests.test_ui_localization -v
python -m unittest tests.test_editor_scenarios -v
python scripts\simulation\validation_guardrails.py --verbose
git diff --check
git diff --cached --check
```

Current result:

- Markdown links: PASS.
- UI localization tests: PASS.
- Editor scenario tests: PASS.
- Diff whitespace checks: PASS.
- Validation guardrails: FAIL, expected/current validation-lane issue.

The validation guardrail failure is not caused by repo organization or missing docs. The remaining blockers are:

- 16 required validation checks fail in `sim/validation/reports/reference_checks.json`.
- 1 Phase 2E sentinel fails: `g4 FED timing [s]`, actual `160.0833`, expected `201.5000 +/- 10.00`.

The following guardrail parts are now clean:

- Gap count is synchronized: `76` non-gating gaps in JSON and docs.
- Physics override linter passes.
- Carbon/HCN sentinels pass.
- Legacy/two-zone contract passes.
- CFAST truth integrity passes.

## Important Constraint

No simulation motor, editor runtime, visualizer runtime, scenes, HUD logic or physics formulas were intentionally changed during this cleanup. The only validation case change was removing the forbidden `vent_bernoulli_flow_multiplier` override from `sim/validation/cases/cfast_pool_fire_open.json`.

Do not try to make `validation_guardrails.py` green by widening tolerances, rewriting reports or reclassifying required failures unless the scientific validation decision has been explicitly reviewed.

## Suggested Next Step

Close this repository hygiene phase as its own commit or series of commits, then handle validation failures as a separate workstream.
